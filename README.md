#Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning 
🩺 
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals by analyzing medical data using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis and promote proactive healthcare interventions.

📌 Objective
Develop a predictive model that accurately classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical attributes such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and more.

📊 Dataset
Utilized the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes 768 records with 8 clinical features:

Pregnancies

Glucose

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin

BMI

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

🛠️ Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized features, and performed exploratory data analysis.

Model Implementation: Trained multiple classifiers including:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation: Assessed models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best-performing algorithm.

🧠 Motivation
With diabetes being a prevalent health issue worldwide, early detection is crucial. This project aims to leverage machine learning to provide a tool that can aid in the timely diagnosis of diabetes, potentially improving patient outcomes.

📁 Project Structure
DiabetesPrediction/: Contains the main Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model training.

README.md: Provides an overview and documentation of the project.
